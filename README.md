# Pathways For Students - CAA

Created by Nelson Gardner-Challis (@NelsonG-C)

## Project Overview

I produced a prototype build of the Pathways for Students tool for Cellular Agriculture Australia, which will be used to assist students in understanding the field and how they can take their next career step. I volunteered to produce this prototype to assist in the development process of the tool. This was used by the team to clarify features and needs to be implemented for the final version.

I created this project using the following stack:

- React
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- AWS RDS (used and tested with for to develop understanding of the sites relational links - not implemented into the build at this stage)
